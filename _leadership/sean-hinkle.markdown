Sean joined DC SCORES in 2009 after working with Grassroot Soccer in South Africa. There he helped design and implement “11 for Health in Africa,” a public health campaign aimed at African youth that combines soccer with 11 different health, social, and life skills messages. The "11 for Health" program has since expanded to eight other countries. While in Africa, he also co-founded Ragball International, a soccer-based income-generation and entrepreneurial development program. Prior to Grassroot Soccer, Sean worked at the U.S. Soccer Foundation where he helped oversee the Passback Program and manage grants.

Sean received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education in 2007. At UVA, he was also a four-year member of the varsity men’s soccer team. In his current role, Sean supports and leads the administrative and operational strategy and functions of the organization.
